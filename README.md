# hardest_typing_game
An open source project to create the hardest typing game 

Initially built with jQuery, this game is set to be the hardest typing game known to man kind. 

Feel free to add more levels, power ups,power downs, music, pop ups, animations, and anything you think that can make this game more difficult. 

For now, letters appear in different colour circles. Each time a letter on screen is typed that is on screen, all letters on screen disappear and the user earns points. If you type a letter not on screen, you lose a life. Lose all your lives it's game over. If there are 20 circles on screen, it's game over too. Right now level one has been created. After 30 seconds, circles start moving horizontally. 

The floodgates are open, let the coding begin.
